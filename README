This repository contains a base class for the creation of user scripts that will apply subreddit-specific emotes
to all sections of reddit.

It also includes several examples of implementation using this base class.

Files:
reddit-wide-emotes.user.js - Base class to be instantiated/extended. Does nothing by itself.
reddit-wide-emotes-f7u12.user.js - working user script for rage-face emotes from r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
reddit-wide-emotes-mylittleandysonic1.user.js - working user script for pony emotes from r/mylittleandysonic1
